# cheque

Like wearing a toque in the winter, ensuring your software is secure should be
second nature, eh.

`Cheque` helps you by finding all libraries used by your C/C++ projects, from A to Zed,
and retrieving known vulnerabilities from [OSS Index](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/).
This process saves you a significant amount of labour and time, which is much
better spent playing hockey, slamming back a two-four, drinking a double-double,
or pretty much anything else rather then poring through obtuse lists and
reading Makefiles.

And its completely free! Beauty, eh?

WARNING: This code is currently in development, and will almost certainly not
do what you want it to; it is pretty hosed. Sorry.
